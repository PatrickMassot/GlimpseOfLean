# Introduction to this tutorial

If you have a small screen and you are reading this in VSCode, you can press
`alt-Z` (or `option-Z`) to enable word wrap.

Welcome to this tutorial designed to give you a glimpse of Lean in a couple of hours.

First let us see what a Lean proof looks like, without trying to understand any syntactical
detail yet. You won't have to type anything in this file.

If everything works, you currently see a panel to the right of this text with a
message like "No info found."
This panel will start displaying interesting things inside the proof.

Note that any text between `/-` and `-/` or after a `--` is a comment for you
that is ignored by Lean.

First let us review two calculus definitions.
-/

/-- A sequence `u` of real numbers converges to `l` if `∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u_n - l| ≤ ε`.
This condition will be spelled `seq_limit u l`. -/
def seq_limit (u : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ) : Prop :=
∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - l| ≤ ε

/- In the above definition, note that the `n`-th term of the sequence `u` is denoted
simply by `u n`.

Similarly, in the next definition, `f x` is what we would write `f(x)` on paper.
Also note that implication is denoted by a single arrow (we'll explain why later).

Something more subtle is that we write `l : ℝ` to say `l` is a real number, where you
may write `l ∈ ℝ` on paper.
-/

/-- A function`f : ℝ → ℝ` is continuous at `x₀` if
`∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ ⇒ |f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ ε`.
This condition will be spelled `continuous_at f x₀`.-/
def continuous_at (f : ℝ → ℝ) (x₀ : ℝ) : Prop :=
∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - f x₀| ≤ ε

/-- Now we claim that if `f` is continuous at `x₀` then it is sequentially continuous
at `x₀`: for any sequence `u` converging to `x₀`, the sequence `f ∘ u` converges
to `f x₀`.
Every thing on the next line describes the objects and assumptions, each with its name.
The following line is the claim we need to prove. -/
example (f : ℝ → ℝ) (u : ℕ → ℝ) (x₀ : ℝ) (hu : seq_limit u x₀) (hf : continuous_at f x₀) :
  seq_limit (f ∘ u) (f x₀) := by { -- This `by` keyword marks the beginning of the proof
  -- Put your text cursor here and watch the panel to the right.
  -- Then move your cursor from line to line in the proof while monitoring that panel.

  -- Our goal is to prove that, for any positive `ε`, there exists a natural
  -- number `N` such that, for any natural number `n` at least `N`,
  --  `|f(u_n) - f(x₀)|` is at most `ε`.
  unfold seq_limit
  -- Fix a positive number `ε`.
  intros ε hε
  -- By assumption on `f` applied to this positive `ε`, we get a positive `δ`
  -- such that, for all real number `x`, if `|x - x₀| ≤ δ` then `|f(x) - f(x₀)| ≤ ε` (1).
  obtain ⟨δ, δ_pos, Hf⟩ : ∃ δ > 0, ∀ x, |x - x₀| ≤ δ → |f x - f x₀| ≤ ε := hf ε hε
  -- The assumption on `u` applied to this `δ` gives a natural number `N` such that
  -- for every natural number `n`, if `n ≥ N` then `|u_n - x₀| ≤ δ`   (2).
  obtain ⟨N, Hu⟩ : ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - x₀| ≤ δ := hu δ δ_pos
  -- Let's prove `N` is suitable.
  use N
  -- Fix `n` which is at least `N`. Let's prove `|f(u_n) - f(x₀)| ≤ ε`.
  intros n hn
  -- Thanks to (1) applied to `u_n`, it suffices to prove that `|u_n - x₀| ≤ δ`.
  apply Hf
  -- This follows from property (2) and our assumption on `n`.
  apply Hu n hn
  -- This finishes the proof!

Now that this proof is over, you can choose between the short track or the longer one.
If you want to do the short track on the lean4web server you should go to
https://live.lean-lang.org/#project=GlimpseOfLean&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FPatrickMassot%2FGlimpseOfLean%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmaster%2FGlimpseOfLean%2FExercises%2FShorter.lean.

If you follow the longer track using a local installation or GitPod or Codespaces,
you should use the file explorer to the left of this panel to open the file
`Exercises > 01Rewriting.lean`.
